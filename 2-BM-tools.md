### noteworthy projects to be used in conjunction with BitMessage:
***
https://github.com/michrob/bitboard web interface, use BM via firefox, better than _BitMessageForum_

https://github.com/majestrate/BitMessageForum web interface, bitboard is better though


***
use ThunderBird to read BM:  https://github.com/Arceliar/bmwrapper   

runs a localhost:12344 pop3-mailserver for BM so ThunderBird is being used to read & write BM besides the original GUI. The "**claws**" mail-app can be used too, which has nice a python plug-in to have claws scripted and modified.

puts everything in one huge INBOX initially. Use filters in ThuBi to separate the [chan]nels. 

Gives you some more features, e.g. sort BM by size, which you cannot do in pyBM. No full threaded view, though.
